# Fakebeat - friendly and flexible utility to produce random Elasticsearch documents

## About

I often find myself in the need of doing some quick testing on how well my queries perform.

This is similar to already existing makelog, but offers more flexibility.

## Usage

TODO

## Roadmap

[x] support multiple template and count parameters (avoid inline chaining and get total progress that way)
[ ] handle potential errors
[ ] use more Rust idioms

[ ] add more generators
[ ] support parameters in generators
[ ] support cloud setups
[ ] support parallel inserts
[ ] add more templates, adhering to ECS
[ ] add tests
