# Fakebeat - friendly and flexible utility to produce random Elasticsearch documents

## About

I often find myself in the need of doing some quick testing on how well my queries perform.

This is similar to already existing `makelog`, but offers more flexibility.

## Usage

TODO

## Roadmap

[x] support multiple template and count parameters (avoid inline chaining and get total progress that way)
[x] support parameters in generators
[ ] better error handling
[x] use more Rust idioms
[ ] support cloud setups
[ ] add more generators
[ ] support parallel inserts
[ ] add tests

[ ] configure github actions
[ ] provide mac os and linux releases
[ ] write docs (mention the ability to omit mappings completely)
